This project is a remote control for a model rocket launch pad. It uses an Arduino Nano Every microcontroller, an HC-12 radio module, and two buttons. The remote control allows you to start a countdown for launching the rocket by pressing button 1. If you need to abort the countdown for any reason, you can press button 2. The remote control is powered by a power bank that is directly connected to the Arduino. This remote control project is designed to work with the [Model Rocket Launch Pad](https://github.com/tomkuttler/TVC-Launch-Pad-Code).
